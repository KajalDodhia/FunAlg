Description: Given 2 R data frames representing the preferences of each male and female, this package will return a stable matching using the fundamental algorithm. The fundamental algorithm follows the psuedocode from page 9 of Donald E. Knuth's (1996) book: Stable Marriage and Its Relation to Other Combinatorial Problems : An Introduction to the Mathematical Analysis of Algorithms.
